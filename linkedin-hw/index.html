        <p>
          I’m grateful to share that I’ve been promoted to Assistant Vice
          President - Software Engineer II A. Thankful for the continued trust,
          guidance and support from my managers, mentors and teammates. Over the
          past few years, working in a highly regulated and large-scale
          environment has helped me grow not only as an engineer, but also in
          how I think about reliability, risk and the long-term impact of
          technology decisions. Looking forward to continuing the same work -
          learning, building resilient systems and contributing meaningfully to
          the teams around me.
